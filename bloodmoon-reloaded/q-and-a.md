# Q & A

**I have an issue or suggestion!**

The best place to post this is on Github!

You can find it [here](https://github.com/refractored/BloodmoonReloaded/issues/new/choose)!

**Does this plugin support Spigot?**

No, Please use [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) (or its [forks](https://luminescent.dev/forks/))...&#x20;

**Your plugin is missing a feature that was in "Bloodmoon \[Updated]"!**

There likely is an extension for it! The only feature that wont be ported over is the levels.

Features part of the original plugin will be free.

{% content-ref url="extensions.md" %}
[extensions.md](extensions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**How to disable the purchase message?**

Buy the plugin.

If you did buy the plugin add this to your config:

```
DisablePurchaseMessage: true
```
