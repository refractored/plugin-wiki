# Purchase

The plugin can be purchased on Polymart.

[https://polymart.org/resource/bloodmoon-reloaded.7375/](https://polymart.org/resource/bloodmoon-reloaded.7375/)\
\
Giveaways & Dev builds are on the server.\
\
Due to how spigot works, I sadly cant post the plugin onto there as plugins on that platform must support regular SpigotMC.\
\
Once[ Paper's Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/) releases their program to allow premium plugins I will also be releasing there.
