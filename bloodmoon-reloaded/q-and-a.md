# Q & A

**I have an issue or suggestion!**

The best place to post this is on Github!

You can find it [here](https://github.com/refractored/BloodmoonReloaded/issues/new/choose)!

**Does this plugin support Spigot?**

No, Please use [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) (or its [forks](https://luminescent.dev/forks/))...&#x20;

**Your plugin is missing a feature that was in "Bloodmoon \[Updated]"!**

There likely is an extension for it! The only feature that wont be ported over is the levels.

Features part of the original plugin will be free.

{% content-ref url="extensions.md" %}
[extensions.md](extensions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**How to disable the purchase message?**

Buy the plugin.

If you did buy the plugin add this to your config:

```
DisablePurchaseMessage: true
```

**How to uninstall the plugin?**

Uninstall the plugin like you would any other plugin BUT make sure there aren't any active bloodmoons!

If you already uninstalled don't fret! You can just reinstall the plugin and disable the bloodmoon then uninstall OR you can manually revert changes that were made to the server.
